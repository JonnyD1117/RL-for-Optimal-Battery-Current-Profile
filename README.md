# RL-for-Optimal-Battery-Current-Profile

The purpose of this repo is to implement a first principles battery model, perform sensitivity analysis, and output the optimal current time series which yeilds the highest battery parameter sensitivity, in OpenAI Gym. 

The direct solution, optimizing the current profile has been perform by Qingzhi Lai, of UC Davis under the direction of Dr. Xifan Lin, in the Department of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering. 

The objective for this code, is to compare a **direct** solution method, with a more indirect solution obtained using Reinforcement Learning.
